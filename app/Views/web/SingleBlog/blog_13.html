    <h3>
        <li>
            High-Quality Medical Education
        </li>
    </h3><br>
    <p>
        One of the primary reasons why Indian students choose Bangladesh for studying MBBS abroad is the quality of
        education. The medical colleges in Bangladesh are known for following the same curriculum as Indian medical
        colleges, and most of them are approved by the Medical Council of India (MCI). This ensures that the degree is
        valid in India, and students are eligible to sit for the Foreign Medical Graduates Examination (FMGE) to
        practice medicine in India.
    </p><br>
    <p>
        The teaching methodology focuses heavily on both theoretical knowledge and practical clinical training. With
        modern medical facilities and experienced faculty members, students are well-equipped to handle real-life
        medical situations, making them competent medical professionals.
    </p><br>
    <h3>
        <li>
            Affordable Fees and Living Costs
        </li>
    </h3><br>
    <p>
        One of the biggest concerns for Indian students seeking to study MBBS abroad is the cost involved. Compared to
        other popular countries like the USA, UK, or even Russia, Bangladesh offers a significantly more affordable MBBS
        program. The tuition fees in Bangladesh are considerably lower than in private medical colleges in India, making
        it a cost-effective option.
    </p><br>
    <p>
        The living expenses in Bangladesh are also very affordable. With similar lifestyles and cultural practices,
        Indian students can comfortably adapt to the environment without having to spend exorbitant amounts on food,
        accommodation, or travel. This cost-effectiveness is one of the key reasons why students choose to study MBBS in
        Bangladesh.
    </p><br>
    <h3>
        <li>
            MCI-Approved Universities
        </li>
    </h3><br>
    <p>
        When Indian students decide to study MBBS abroad, one of the most crucial factors they need to consider is
        whether the degree is recognized in India. Medical universities in Bangladesh are approved by the Medical
        Council of India (MCI), which ensures that the degree holders are eligible to practice in India after passing
        the FMGE (Foreign Medical Graduates Examination).
    </p><br>
    <p>
        This MCI approval is a significant factor that attracts students to Bangladesh as it eliminates the uncertainty
        about the recognition of the degree and allows a smooth transition back to India for practicing medicine.
    </p><br>
    <h3>
        <li>
            Cultural and Linguistic Similarities
        </li>
    </h3><br>
    <p>
        One of the reasons why many Indian students find it easier to adapt to studying in Bangladesh is the cultural
        and linguistic similarities between the two countries. Bangladesh shares a lot of cultural practices with India,
        especially for students from West Bengal, Bihar, Assam, and other neighboring states. The food, festivals, and
        traditions are very similar, making Indian students feel more at home.
    </p><br>
    <p>
        Additionally, the medium of instruction for MBBS in Bangladesh is English, which removes any language barrier.
        Indian students do not have to struggle with learning a new language and can focus entirely on their medical
        studies.
    </p><br>
    <h3>
        <li>
            Proximity to India
        </li>
    </h3><br>
    <p>
        Studying in a foreign country can often be overwhelming due to the distance from home. However, Bangladesh is
        geographically close to India, making it easier for students to travel back home during holidays or emergencies.
        This close proximity reduces travel expenses and ensures that students can visit their families more frequently.
    </p><br>
    <p>
        Many Indian cities have direct flights to Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, making travel convenient and
        accessible. This geographical advantage is another reason why Indian students prefer studying MBBS in Bangladesh
        over other distant countries.

    <h3>
        <li>
            Excellent Clinical Exposure
        </li>
    </h3><br>
    <p>
        One of the key components of medical education is practical clinical exposure. Medical universities in
        Bangladesh have tie-ups with government and private hospitals where students receive substantial clinical
        training. They are trained in real-time hospital settings, handling a large number of patients, and gaining
        practical experience in diagnosing and treating various medical conditions.
    </p><br>
    <p>
        This exposure is invaluable for aspiring doctors as it enhances their practical skills and prepares them to
        handle medical emergencies effectively.
    </p><br>
    <h3>
        <li>
            Recognition by International Bodies
        </li>

        Medical universities in Bangladesh are recognized by international organizations such as the World Health
        Organization (WHO) and various medical councils across the globe. This global recognition provides Indian
        students with opportunities to pursue further studies or work in other countries after completing their MBBS in
        Bangladesh.

    <p>
        A degree from a recognized university in Bangladesh holds value not only in India but also in several other
        countries, making it a viable option for students looking to have a global medical career.

        </li>
    </h3><br>
    <p>
        The admission process to study MBBS abroad in Bangladesh is straightforward and hassle-free. Most universities
        in Bangladesh do not require students to take any additional entrance exams apart from the NEET, which is
        mandatory for Indian students. The eligibility criteria are easy to meet, and students who have cleared NEET can
        apply directly to universities.
